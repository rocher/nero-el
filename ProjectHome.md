Nero is a fast interactive web browser that runs under Emacs. It
uses 'lynx -dump' to generate page content. Navigation is
typically done via numbered links, a la Conkeror.
Better-than-just-browsing interaction with various useful web
services is done via elvi, a la Surfraw.
Fast access to commonly used pages is available through a
programmable hotlist, a la webjump.
Facilities for 'tabbed browsing' a la (insert name of browser) are
available. And Nero saves pages that have been
browsed for later use.

Finally, Nero provides facilities that let you easily plug in Emacs Lisp
code to do the following two things:

- to change the way pages display; or,

- to automatically browse the web for you.
